      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m excited to announce that the third paper from my PhD has been accepted for publication in Journal of Social Policy. The paper argues that analyses of gender and welfare states should be broadened to include women’s share of corporate board and executive positions and the policies that help to address the lack of gender diversity in such positions. Bringing more women into the most powerful jobs can lead to more ‘female-friendly’ workplace policies, practices, and cultures (e.g. workplace childcare facilities, sexual-harassment training), which can contribute to addressing some of the gendered ‘social risks’ (e.g. work/family conflicts, violations of body rights) faced by women further down the labour market.&lt;/p&gt;
