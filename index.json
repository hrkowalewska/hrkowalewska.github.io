Hence, comparative social-science researchers, the press, and politicians hail Scandinavian societies as a gender equality \u0026lsquo;paradise\u0026rsquo; and a role model for the UK because of their generous public sectors (e.g. Esping-Andersen, 2016). Yet, prior research has suggested a welfare state \u0026lsquo;paradox\u0026rsquo;: while \u0026lsquo;women-friendly\u0026rsquo; welfare states achieve high female employment rates, they also frustrate women\u0026rsquo;s access to male-dominated jobs by increasing discrimination against women and funnelling women into female-typed public-sector positions (Mandel and Semyonov, 2006).\nHowever, most studies on the welfare state paradox use data from 2000 or earlier. But a lot has changed since then. Nordic labour markets are no longer the most gender-segregated and, on some measures of segregation, outperform less women-friendly countries, including the UK. Thus, the relationship between women-friendly measures and gender employment segregation appears more complex than paradox theory predicts. The purpose of this project is to shed light on such complexity through the following objectives:\n To situate the relationship between ‘women-friendly’ social policies and gender employment segregation within the broader macro-level context. Do generous family policies always lead to segregation? Or can certain conditions (e.g. gender boardroom quotas) help to \u0026lsquo;cancel out\u0026rsquo; the negative impact of family policies on women\u0026rsquo;s careers? Up-to-date data will be analysed using methods that have not been used to explore the welfare state paradox before. To go beyond the country and clarify how the impacts of welfare states on women\u0026rsquo;s careers vary within countries according to a region\u0026rsquo;s specific economic and social context using multilevel regression models. Research has shown that occupational sex segregation is contingent on the structure of local labour markets, their sociodemographic composition and the dominant gender-role ideology (Perales and Vidal, 2015). By examining the applicability of paradox theory to NUTS regions across 20 countries, the research can provide an evidence base for locally tailored policy solutions. To carry out an intersectional analysis of women-friendly policies and gender employment segregation. Intersectionality posits that women are not a homogeneous group, as gender interacts with other dimensions of \u0026lsquo;difference\u0026rsquo; (e.g. class) in shaping people\u0026rsquo;s experiences (Crenshaw, 1991). Prior studies have examined the outcomes of gender/class intersections (e.g. Korpi et al., 2013). The project will build on these studies by interrogating the underlying mechanisms that determine these outcomes.

Most typologies distinguish between a Nordic-style ‘train-first’ approach focused on developing jobseekers’ employability and an Anglo-Saxon ‘work-first’ approach that instead emphasises quick job (re-)entry. These typologies tell us what activation means for the unemployed (male) worker. However, by ignoring the family, they overlook what activation means for the (female) parent-worker with childcare responsibilities. To contribute to filling this gap, this article uses fuzzy-set ideal-type analysis to compare 22 countries representing five ‘worlds’ of welfare by how (de-)activating their labour market policies, parental leave provisions, childcare services and the scheduling of primary education are for lone mothers. It reveals that cross-national variations in support for maternal activation are not well captured by the Nordic-style ‘train-first’/Anglo-Saxon ‘work-first’ dichotomy. Hence, despite the greater attention to gender and ‘new social risks’ within comparative social policy scholarship in recent years, the activation literature remains gender-blind.

Consequently, women are no longer treated as caregivers. Rather, they are required and assumed to be in employment. Although gender has moved from margins to the mainstream of comparative welfare state research in recent years, the agenda of ‘gendering’ the analysis of welfare states under activation remains incomplete. This three-paper thesis contributes to completing this agenda. Papers 1 and 2 assess activation strategies towards lone mothers who, as sole breadwinners and caregivers within their households, are a ‘litmus test’ of gendered social rights. Focusing on the UK, Paper 1 shows that, against the commonplace characterisation of the UK as a pioneer of ‘making work pay’, changes to the UK’s tax-benefit system since 2010 have weakened lone mothers’ financial incentives to work beyond a few hours a week. Paper 2 subsequently builds on Paper 1 in dimensional and geographical scope by examining how active labour market and family policies across 22 welfare states help or hinder lone mothers’ employment. It shows that cross-national variations in support for maternal activation are not well captured by the commonplace dichotomy within the mainstream literature between a Nordic-style ‘train-first’ approach to activation and an Anglo-Saxon ‘work-first’ approach. Paper 3 then extends Papers 1 and 2 in conceptual terms. It argues that analysing women’s social risks under activation requires looking not just at active labour market and family policies. Also important are gender boardroom quotas and other regulatory policies that set numerical targets for women in top corporate board and executive positions. This is because a ‘critical mass’ (23-40 per cent) of women in top management can generate important ‘trickle-down’ benefits, which can help to alleviate some of the ‘new’ social risks (e.g. work/care conflicts, in-work poverty) faced by women at the bottom of the labour market under activation.

This is mainly because women are more likely than men to take career breaks for children and return as mothers to work in more poorly paid ‘flexible’ and part-time ‘mummy track’ careers that are often well below their skill level.","tags":[],"title":"What women don’t want: how many countries still ‘mummy track’ women","type":"media"},{"authors":["Helen Kowalewska"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1435186800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1435186800,"objectID":"8ec38240d85975e0c06c308731d659fb","permalink":"https://helenkowalewska.uk/publication/2015-diminishing-returns/","publishdate":"2019-06-24T18:18:47+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2015-diminishing-returns/","section":"publication","summary":"Lone mothers in the UK are a key target group of tax-benefit measures designed to ‘make work pay’. This article assesses how the Conservative–Liberal Democrat Coalition's ‘make work pay’ agenda since 2010 has potentially affected single mothers. It calculates two lone mothers’ incomes and incentives for a range of working hours and wage rates under the Coalition and previous New Labour government. While the Coalition's measures substantially improve the lone mothers’ incentives to work in mini-jobs of fewer than sixteen hours, their incentives to work longer are still weak, if not weaker than under Labour. Furthermore, the financial returns to progressing in work begin to diminish once hours exceed just six at average wage and nine at minimum wage. While tougher conditionality may still push many lone parents to work longer, weak labour demand and reduced employment supports could undermine their abilities to meet increased work expectations.","tags":[],"title":"Diminishing Returns: Lone Mothers’ Work Incentives and Incomes under the Coalition.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Helen Kowalewska"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"14889f4df3f62d5c98d891914a12c77e","permalink":"https://helenkowalewska.uk/talk/2019-bringing-women-on-board-family-policies-and-quotas/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2019-bringing-women-on-board-family-policies-and-quotas/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Bringing Women on Board?
