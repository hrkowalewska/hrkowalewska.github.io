      <title>Welfare State Interventions and Occupational Gender Segregation: Paradise or Paradox?</title>
      <link>https://helenkowalewska.uk/project/esrc-new-investigators-grant/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welfare states enable women&amp;rsquo;s employment through the family policies they provide and the jobs they create. Hence, comparative social-science researchers, the press, and politicians hail Scandinavian societies as a gender equality &amp;lsquo;paradise&amp;rsquo; and a role model for the UK because of their generous public sectors (e.g. Esping-Andersen, 2016). Yet, prior research has suggested a welfare state &amp;lsquo;paradox&amp;rsquo;: while &amp;lsquo;women-friendly&amp;rsquo; welfare states achieve high female employment rates, they also frustrate women&amp;rsquo;s access to male-dominated jobs by increasing discrimination against women and funnelling women into female-typed public-sector positions (Mandel and Semyonov, 2006).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, most studies on the welfare state paradox use data from 2000 or earlier. But a lot has changed since then. Nordic labour markets are no longer the most gender-segregated and, on some measures of segregation, outperform less women-friendly countries, including the UK. Thus, the relationship between women-friendly measures and gender employment segregation appears more complex than paradox theory predicts. The purpose of this project is to shed light on such complexity through the following objectives:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To situate the relationship between ‘women-friendly’ social policies and gender employment segregation within the broader macro-level context. Do generous family policies always lead to segregation? Or can certain conditions (e.g. gender boardroom quotas) help to &amp;lsquo;cancel out&amp;rsquo; the negative impact of family policies on women&amp;rsquo;s careers? Up-to-date data will be analysed using methods that have not been used to explore the welfare state paradox before.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To go beyond the country and clarify how the impacts of welfare states on women&amp;rsquo;s careers vary within countries according to a region&amp;rsquo;s specific economic and social context using multilevel regression models. Research has shown that occupational sex segregation is contingent on the structure of local labour markets, their sociodemographic composition and the dominant gender-role ideology (Perales and Vidal, 2015). By examining the applicability of paradox theory to NUTS regions across 20 countries, the research can provide an evidence base for locally tailored policy solutions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To carry out an intersectional analysis of women-friendly policies and gender employment segregation. Intersectionality posits that women are not a homogeneous group, as gender interacts with other dimensions of &amp;lsquo;difference&amp;rsquo; (e.g. class) in shaping people&amp;rsquo;s experiences (Crenshaw, 1991). Prior studies have examined the outcomes of gender/class intersections (e.g. Korpi et al., 2013). The project will build on these studies by interrogating the underlying mechanisms that determine these outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Social Policies to Support Women’s Employment and Achieve Gender-Friendly Workplaces</title>
      <link>https://helenkowalewska.uk/project/social-policies-to-support-womens-employment/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This project: (1) presented a social rationale for gender diversity in the boardroom,
which posits that putting more women on boards can help to combat the sexual
subordination of women in the workplace and reduce the incidence of social risk for
women at lower levels of the labour market; (2) analysed the policy factors that help
us to understand why some advanced economies have been more successful than
others in addressing women’s underrepresentation on corporate boards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first part of the project was conceptual and went beyond the business case and
justice or ‘fairness’ arguments for gender-diverse boards by proposing a social
rationale. This involved synthesising evidence from across multiple disciplines to
show the relevance of women’s board membership - and the policies designed to
increase it - for scholars and policymakers interested in women’s ‘social risks’,
including employment/care conflicts, economic dependence on a partner, inadequate
social security coverage, and low wages. Women in board and executive roles signal
that the organisation values women and are often ‘agents of change’ in pushing for
organisational policies, practices, and cultures that improve the ‘women-friendliness’
of workplaces. These include measures to combat sexual harassment, action to
reduce gender wage disparities in the firm and flexible working arrangements, which
can benefit all women in the company, including the lowest earners. This argument
strengthens the case for greater government action in its role as regulator of market
actors’ behaviours through legislation designed to break the ‘glass ceiling’ at the top
of companies. You can read the peer-reviewed paper &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-social-policy/article/abs/bringing-women-on-board-the-social-policy-implications-of-gender-diversity-in-top-jobs/59FE25C7DD363901F07AE089B79BFA2D&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second part of the project was an empirical analysis of the policies associated
with a ‘critical mass’ of women on boards. An influential body of work has identified a
‘welfare-state paradox’: work–family policies that bring women into the workforce
also undermine women’s access to top jobs. Missing from this literature is a
consideration of how welfare-state interventions impact on women’s representation
at the board-level specifically, rather than managerial and lucrative positions more
generally. This research contributed to addressing this ‘gap’ by examining how
welfare-state interventions combine with gender boardroom quotas and regulations
in (not) bringing a critical mass of women onto boards. It did this through a fuzzy-set
Qualitative Comparative Analysis of 22 advanced economies, which involved
analysing countries as ‘packages’ of policies and looking at the shares of women on
boards that are associated with each package. Macro-level data were collated
mainly from various Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development
databases. Overall, the analysis found limited evidence in support of a welfare-state
paradox. Rather, countries are unlikely to achieve a critical mass of women on
boards in the absence of adequate childcare services. Furthermore, ‘hard’,
mandatory gender boardroom quotas are not necessary for achieving more women
on boards; ‘soft’, voluntary recommendations can also work under certain family
policy constellations. You can read the peer-reviewed paper &lt;a href=&#34;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0950017020971221&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
