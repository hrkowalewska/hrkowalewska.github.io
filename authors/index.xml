      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Department of Social Policy and Intervention and the Institute for New Economic Thinking at the University of Oxford. As part of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.inet.ox.ac.uk/projects/the-oxford-martin-programme-on-inequality-and-prosperity/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Oxford Martin Programme on Inequality and Prosperity&lt;/a&gt;, my research looks at the relationship between labour market and family policies and women’s employment position across advanced economies. I use both quantitative and qualitative methods in my research, including model family analysis and Qualitative Comparative Analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I received my &lt;a href=&#34;https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/417383/1/Helen_Kowalewska_Minor_Corrections.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;ESRC-funded PhD&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Southampton in 2018. The thesis sought to bring a gendered perspective to debates on labour market ‘activation’. For this, I won the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.southampton.ac.uk/socsci/news/2016/10/social-science-researcher-wins-top-european-award.page&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;2016 Doctoral Researcher Prize&lt;/a&gt;, awarded by the Journal of European Social Policy and European Network for Social Policy Analysis for ‘exciting, innovative and scholarly’ work. All three of my papers from my PhD have been published in leading peer-reviewed journals. I also hold an MSc in Social Policy (Distinction) and BSc in Politics (First), both from the University of Southampton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have also held postdoc positions at the University of Southampton. I was part of the ESRC-funded project, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cpc.ac.uk/projects/57/Female_Breadwinner_Families_in_Europe#overview&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Female-Breadwinner Families in Europe&lt;/a&gt; and have submitted a co-authored paper from this project for peer review. In addition, in 2018 I was awarded an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cpc.ac.uk/projects/98/Social_policies_to_support_womens_employment_and_achieve_gender_friendly_workplaces#overview&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;ESRC Fellowship&lt;/a&gt; (grant no. ES/S010793/1), where I examined the impacts of ‘women-friendly’ social policies (maternity leaves, childcare services, etc.) on women’s access to top board positions in private companies through a fuzzy-set analysis. I plan to build on this through a larger three-year project funded through an ESRC New Investigator Grant (no. ES/S010793/1). This will examine the relationship between welfare states and gender segregation in employment across OECD countries.&lt;/p&gt;
